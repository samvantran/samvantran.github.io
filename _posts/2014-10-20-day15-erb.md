### Wyatt ERB: The dynamic-loading gunslinging template system that fires Ruby right into HTML code.

ERB is a templating system that makes it easy to execute Ruby commands when loading HTML pages. I was having trouble wrapping my head around how it works, what specific methods were doing, and how to properly connect models with the view templates.

The biggest thing that kept troubling me was this block of code from one of our labs but after prying around, I finally understand. Here's the code:

{% highlight ruby %}
index = File.open("./tmp/_site/artists/index.html", "w+")
template = File.read("./app/views/artists/index.html.erb")
@artists = Artist.all
html = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
index.write(html)
index.close
{% endhighlight %}

This block:
  
  * creates an empty HTML file to be written
  * reads in a template file that has pre-written HTML with ERB syntax (which serves as the base of your webpage)
  * then you instantiate all object instances that are needed for the ERB object
  * instantiate a new ERB object; pass in the template file; call result while passing in "binding"
  * lastly, you write the contents to the empty HTML file and close it

This is your template file:

{% highlight erb %}
<h1><%= @artists.name %></h1>

<h2>Songs</h2>
<ul>
  <% @artists.songs.each do |song| %>
  ...
{% endhighlight %}

If you opened `pry` and inspected ERB.new(template) you would find:

{% highlight ruby %}
#<ERB:0x007ffb04fb5868
 @enc=#<Encoding:UTF-8>,
 @filename=nil,
 @safe_level=nil,
 @src=
  "#coding:UTF-8\n_erbout.concat(( artist.name ).to_s);
{% endhighlight %}

Calling `ERB.new(template).result` without binding will result in this error:

{% highlight ruby %}
pry(#<SiteGenerator>)> template.result
NameError: undefined local variable or method `artist' for main:Object
{% endhighlight ruby %}
 
but including binding (which is an object that houses all data of the current session then executes this: 

{% highlight html %}
 <h1>A$AP Rocky</h1>   
{% endhighlight ruby %}

This was great and all but I didn't fully understand ERB until I finally applied it to a personal project. I took our Student Scraper CLI project, built a SiteGenerator model with an ERB template to produce this beauty:

Here's my code:

Model:
{% highlight ruby %}
class SiteGenerator 
  def generate_page
    @students_hash = create_hash_of_students
    index = File.open('./_site/index.html', 'w+')
    template = File.read('./lib/templates/student.html.erb')
    html = ERB.new(template).result(binding)
    index.write(html)
    index.close
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

View:
{% highlight erb %}

<h2>All Le Ruby 006 Students</h2>

<% @students_hash.each do |student, attributes| %>
<img src="<%= @students_hash[student][:image] %>" style="width:150px; height:150px;" ></img></br>
<h4><%= student %> - <%= @students_hash[student][:front_tagline] %></h4></br>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}
