Day 0, we jumped right into it. Avi made a small introduction and split us up into groups to tackle the first lab. We basically built a static website for the person next to us after exchanging information (links, websites, github profiles, twitter handles, favorite hobbies, etc). Then we merged our repos into master and pushed it onto the main site.

Afterward, we had lunch; mixed and mingled with fellow students; did an icebreaker; Avi gave a lecture on Flatiron School's history and values; short bios on Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, and their Difference and Analytical Engines; and last, he went through some of the basics and not-so-basics of Git and sent us to complete our 2nd lab of the day, which consisted of reconciling merge conflicts (*shudder)

The students seem to have interesting backgrounds. Some come from finance, consulting; a few ex-teachers; others just came back from a backpacking trip across Europe or SE Asia; some, just arrived from overseas. It's an extremely diverse group but they have common characteristics - they are driven, smart, and friendly.

So far, so good.
