Flatiron School was a life-changing experience. It's what I hoped for and more. I challenged myself every day; met a ton of ambitious and intelligent people who I now call friends, and most importantly, I walked away with a profoundly valuable skill: the ability to turn ideas into reality through programming.

The following list doesn't cover everything but here are some reasons why I loved my FS journey:

### I worked very, very hard.

On average, I spent roughly 10-15 hours a day (~70 hours/week, including weekends) devoted to code. This meant sitting in lectures, working on labs, writing blog posts, or building my own projects. A few times a week I found myself still on campus at 9pm (days start at 9am). The only reason why I didn't leave later was because I had a 1.5 hour commute and 9:30 was the last express train home. But when I got home, I still wrote code. 

### I was challenged.

No one will tell you that programming is easy. It's hard. Like, really hard. It's mind-bending work and you constantly have to hold a million different puzzle pieces in your brain in order to solve the problem. Some days, I felt defeated. Other days, I felt like I was the champion of the world. Programming, with its instant feedback loop, will constantly play with your emotions. But when things work, you will feel a sense of accomplishment like no other. It really is addicting. Which brings me to my next point:

### I fell in love with programming.

NextStep was the very first app I built that belonged entirely to me (Vaidehi too). It wasn't built from a spec. It wasn't a homework assignment or online tutorial walkthrough. I had a question, "Where do Flatiron grads end up?", and Vaidehi and I built the answer. We spent 30 hours each (in one weekend!) sprucing that baby up and I can tell you that when we finished demoing the app, I went to bed that night thinking "God damn I'm so happy to be a programmer". Building NextStep gave me joy, and it also confirmed that I **truly love** programming. Building my two other apps (PitchIn and Ski Mountain Memories) and even doing code challenges (for interviews) have consistently reaffirmed this.

### Every student was committed to excellence.

Every student was (still is) Type-A. They worked just as hard as I did, if not more. Every week we had our Flatiron Presents, and every week, the next pair of students would build a bigger and better app. I thought my LinkedIn scraper was cool until the next week when a pair of students built this beautifully designed recipe-aggregator that returned the top recipes found on the web. The next week, a pair of students built Tinder for apartment hunters. It just got cooler and cooler. This wasn't competitive by the way, it was just us being us - wanting to build the very best thing we knew how to build at the time.

### I met incredible people.

The students are wicked smart. The staff are wonderfully nice and humble (also wicked smart). Everyone is awesome. By the end, I made a great new group of friends. They're all so ambitious, so thoughtful, and I easily enjoyed hanging out with them in non-work/school settings (read: getting drunk together). They're just good people - the type you want around in your life.

### The students are diverse.

I'm talking ex-teachers, consultants, i-bankers, engineers, college grads (with CS degrees), people that flew in from Brazil and London (just for the program), software devs, parents, start up founders, DJ, product managers, real-estate analysts, journalists, photographers, and 1 tech-recruiter ;) More than half the students were women. With so many backgrounds, you get a vibrant, fun culture.

### Feelings Friday

This was not for everyone but I'm an ENFJ, so naturally, I love this shit. Basically, you spend an hour every Friday letting out your thoughts and feelings for the week to the entire class. It's uncensored; no time-limit; completely genuine. Some students say a lot while others finish in one sentence. Some weeks, you see a new side to someone you never even expected. There are laughs and there are tears. But no judgment.

### The Placements Team is LEGIT.

This is what everyone wished career services or recruiting actually was. The Placements Team works hard to find you interviews (and get you hired) when you graduate. They are not money-hungry, commission-based recruiters or jaded, deflated college advisors. They prepare you in a lot of different ways (technically, culturally, etc) and are focused purely on making sure that you actually get the job you want. Best part is: this is for life! They can and will help you with your next move should you decide to search for new employment. I just don't see anything else that exists like that.

### Ruby!

Of course Ruby. Ruby is such a beautiful language and such fun to use. I didn't discover Ruby until I came across the [Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com) but when I did, man did I enjoy it. Most people usually raise an eyebrow when Rubyists talk about their love for the language but Matz (the creator of Ruby) himself, said:

> "I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language." - Yukihiro Matsumoto

Ruby was literally designed for programmer happiness! And lastly:

### Avi is a phenomenal teacher and will inspire you.

You ever hear about those teachers who change the course of their student's lives by making them fall in love with the subject? Avi is one of those teachers. He breaks down technical topics in digestible chunks and works hard to make sure you understand them. He finds simple and relevant analogies to express a complicated idea. He gets famous programmers to come and talk to us. Above all that, I think his greatest trait is his ability to inspire. He starts the first day with this quote:

> “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.” ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

At first, you're like, "What is this hippie mumbo jumbo"? But over time, Avi makes you realize that programming isn't just about programming. It's art. It's expression. It's the culmination of your life and your personality captured in every line of code. And the only reason you do it is because you dream of endless possibilities; writing code is merely the medium in which you explore those possibilities.

I probably sound like I drank too much of the Kool-Aid but the fact is writing software helped me discover something I had been seeking for a long time; captured here:

A month after graduation, I had 3 offers; all vastly different. I chose the one that let me check off a major wishlist item: move to California. I considered over a dozen other factors like growth potential, compensation, industry, teammates, but in my heart what I wanted most was a new life-experience. Shoot, I quit my job to go to back to school, why not up the ante and start a new career on the other side of the country?

It's been an unforgettable journey. I now consider my life in terms of Pre- and Post-Flatiron. I think back on how unhappy I was in my career and what my life would have been like had I stayed doing what I did. I feel very blessed that I was able to make the switch. I wake up much happier these days.

A lot of friends have approached me about my experience and how they might go about changing their own careers. They ask about Flatiron School - what the days were like, what apps I built, how much the program cost. Eventually, they ask the million dollar question, "Was it worth it"? 

My answer has always been, unequivocally, "Yes".
