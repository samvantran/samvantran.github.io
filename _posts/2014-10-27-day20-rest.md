### Programmer of the Day: [Roy Fielding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding)

* Founded Apache HTTP Server
* Co-author of HTTP specification
* pioneered RESTful architecture

Fielding's doctoral disseration, *Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures*, introduced *[representational state transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REST) which has changed the world of network communication and web services.

The verbs that make the web work:

* GET
* POST
* PUT / PATCH
* DELETE

also: 

* OPTIONS
* TRACE
* CONNECT

The idea behind REST is to use consistent URLs that are semantically descriptive i.e.:

{% highlight rest %}
get     /photos
get     /photos/new
post    /photos
get     /photos/:id
get     /photos/:id/edit
put     /photos/:id
delete  /photos/:id

{% endhighlight %}
