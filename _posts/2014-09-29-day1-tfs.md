Day 1 and we jumped right into it. Avi made a small introduction and split us into groups to tackle the first lab. We basically built a static website for the person next to us after exchanging information like links, websites, github profiles, twitter handles, favorite hobbies, etc. Then we merged into one specific branch and pushed onto the main site.

Afterward, we had lunch, mixed and mingled with other students, did an icebreaker, and Avi gave a lecture on TFS' history and values; short bios on Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace, and their Difference and Analytical Engines; and last, he went through some of the basics and not-so-basics of Git and sent us to complete our 2nd lab of the day, which meant dealing with merge conflicts.

Overall, I enjoyed the first day. The "student body" is diverse, and they all seem smart, social, and friendly.
