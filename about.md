Hello! I'm Sam Tran and this is my blog; mostly on code, rapgenius, and internet memes.

In September 2014, I quit my job to chase a dream. I started a new chapter in my life by attending The Flatiron School; where I learned (and am still learning) to become a full stack web developer.

I started this blog on day 1 of that adventure.
